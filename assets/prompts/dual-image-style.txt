STYLE GUIDANCE:
- Clean, engaging comic-style illustration with expressive, readable action.
- Keep compositions bold and readable; avoid tiny micro-details.
- Use confident line work, clear silhouettes, and purposeful posing that reads instantly.
- Prefer white or light neutral backgrounds that keep focus on characters and key props.
- Employ vibrant but harmonious colors; use contrast to separate subject from background.
- Focus on visual metaphors, props, and body language to communicate ideas.
- Keep lighting consistent between the two panels while allowing scene-specific accents.
- Present cinematic camera angles that feel dynamic yet easy to parse.

REMINDER: Deliver strictly visual storytelling. No words, lettering, logos, UI, or symbolic text anywhere in the artwork.
